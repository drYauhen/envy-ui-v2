# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADR) for Envy UI v2. ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, rationale, and consequences.

## Quick Start

- **Template:** [`ADR-TEMPLATE.md`](./ADR-TEMPLATE.md)
- **Workflow:** See [ADR Workflow](../workflows/adr-workflow.md) for complete guide

## ADR Principles

ADRs serve as:
- Historical record of architectural thinking
- Context for understanding why approaches were explored
- Reference material for reflection and analysis

ADRs are NOT:
- Current system documentation
- Authoritative description of present architecture
- Executable instructions for implementation

## ADR Status Values

Common status values:
- **Accepted** - Decision has been accepted and implemented
- **Exploratory** - Decision is being explored, not yet finalized
- **Proposed (Exploratory)** - Decision is proposed and in exploratory phase
- **Superseded** - Decision has been superseded by a later ADR
