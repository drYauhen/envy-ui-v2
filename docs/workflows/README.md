# Workflows Documentation

This directory contains detailed operational workflows for different aspects of the Envy UI v2 design system.

## Overview

Each workflow document describes:
- **What** the workflow is for
- **How** to use the tools and processes
- **When** to apply the workflow
- **Where** files and artifacts are located

## Available Workflows

- **[Tokens Workflow](./tokens-workflow.md)** - Working with design tokens
- **[Figma Workflow](./figma-workflow.md)** - Figma integration (plugin, scripts, artifacts)
- **[Storybook Workflow](./storybook-workflow.md)** - Storybook development and documentation
- **[ADR Workflow](./adr-workflow.md)** - Writing and managing Architectural Decision Records

## Documentation Management

- **[Documentation Guide](../DOCS-GUIDE.md)** - Guide for managing all documentation (link validation, registry, cross-references)

## Relationship to WORKFLOW_MANIFEST.md

The root `WORKFLOW_MANIFEST.md` contains:
- Core rules and conventions
- Project structure principles
- Assistant expectations

This directory (`docs/workflows/`) contains:
- Detailed step-by-step workflows
- Tool usage instructions
- Platform-specific processes

Both documents work together: the manifest provides the framework, workflows provide the details.
