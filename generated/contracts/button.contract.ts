/**
 * How this file was produced:
 * - Source tokens: tokens/components/button/colors.json, tokens/components/button/size.json, tokens/components/button/shape.json, tokens/components/button/colors.json
 * - Axes derived by reading keys at configured JSON paths (or staticValues when provided).
 * - No primitives resolved; only literal keys are emitted.
